# GeoSMS

> Geolocalize a smartphone with an SMS  

The **emergency services** receive more than [2,5 thousand calls per day in France](https://www.gouvernement.fr/risques/connaitre-les-numeros-d-urgence).  
We **have** to know **3 pieces of information** :
- Who am I ?
- Why I'm calling ?
- **Where am I ?**  

And this is on **its last point** we are working to **improve answers**.
When you are calling rescue team, **you might don't know where you are** :
- You are in the forest
- **You are confused**
- You don't know where exactly you are
- And **so many cases**...  

This web-application will **help emergency organisations** to add this new tool and **help them to locating patients** in need.
